Prime field elliptic curves in short-Weierstrass form, as specified in NIST FIPS-186-5[^cite].
Parameterized module PFEC is an optimized reference implementation that uses algorithms from
several sources (see references in that file).
P192, P224, etc. are concrete instantiations of PFEC for the approved parameter sets.
